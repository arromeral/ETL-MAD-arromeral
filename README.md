## Description
This project consists of a complete ETL process (Extract-Transfor-Load) for the generation of a database.
The main guidelines for developing the project are the following:
- Use at least 3 different sources.
- Apply at least two different extraction methods.

The topic on which the project is based will be the generation of a database of all flight departures from the *Madrid-Barajas Adolfo SuÃ¡rez Airport* over a period of one year **(November 2022 - October 2023)**.
Additionally, METAR weather reports for the same period will be extracted, as well as daily data about airport congestion in that period, such as number of operations, cancellation rate, average delays, etc.
