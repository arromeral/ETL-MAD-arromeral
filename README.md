## Description
This project consists of a complete ETL process (Extract-Transfor-Load) for the generation of a database.
The main guidelines for developing the project are the following:
- Use at least 3 different sources.
- Apply at least two different extraction methods.

The topic on which the project is based will be the generation of a database of all flight departures from the *Madrid-Barajas Adolfo SuÃ¡rez Airport* over a period of one year **(November 2022 - October 2023)**.
Additionally, [METAR](https://skybrary.aero/articles/meteorological-aerodrome-report-metar) weather reports for the same period will be extracted, as well as daily data about airport congestion in that period, such as number of operations, cancellation rate, average delays, etc.

## Contents

## Methodology & Sources
Below, the sources and tools used in each of the stages of the project will be briefly explained.

<summary>EXTRACT STAGE</summary>

<details open>
<summary>Fligth Departures Records</summary>
<br>
To extract the records of the desired flights, the webscrapping technique has been used on the flightera website (https://www.flightera.net/en/) , which maintains a rich record of flights since at least 2017.
The main tools used have been Selenium and Pandas.

<summary>METARs</summary>
<br>
To extract the desired METAR reports, the webscrapping technique has been used on the tutiempo website (https://www.tutiempo.net/registros/lemd) , which maintains a rich record of METAR reports since many years ago. 
Furthermore, the structure of said website allows the parallelization of the process, which has considerably reduced the extraction time.
The main tools used have been Joblib, Selenium and Pandas.

<summary>Daily MAD Airport traffic data</summary>
<br>
To extract de desired daily traffic data for the MAD Airport the Eurocontrol website (https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html) has been used, which has an interesting dashboard with valuable information about air traffic in the main European airports.
The website also allows downloading many of the data shown in XLSX format.

Two documents have been downloaded, one related to daily operations at each airport and another with punctuality data.
Once downloaded, the most relevant information has been filtered and a single DataFrame has been generated.

The main tools used have been Pandas and Excel
